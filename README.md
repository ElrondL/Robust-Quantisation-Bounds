# Robust-Quantisation-Bounds

This repository contains codes for the SDP-based frame work to provide robust bound for comparing, quantising and pruning Neural Networks developed by J. Li, R. Drummond, S.R. Duncan in 'Robust error bounds for quantised and pruned neural networks'. This paper is under review for conference L4DC2021 and PMLR.
